~ Abadima#6536 / Please Report any issues that you encounter, so I can help fix them :)

**Instructions**

- *Step 1: Pre-Setup*

     - Make a New Application
     - Head to Rich Presence Section
     - Setup Image Asset IDs (You'll Need Them :)
- *Step 2: Setup*
     - [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) + All Installation Packages
     - Open .env
     - Input App ID (Example: applicationID=696969)
     - Open app.js
     - Run "npm i" into Console of Choice to install required modules
- *step 3: Initiate Rich Presence*
     - Open the start.bat file, and it should indicate that it is working
     - (ALTERNATIVE) run "node app.js" into console of choice

You're Welcome! <3

TIP: I also coded the start.bat file to automatically restart if it does run into an error, so that you don't have to be concerned! However if you wish to close out, just close the cmd file :)
